# BigTwoBot for Discord
A simple Discord bot which allow members to play (Big Two)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two] card game in each channel.
### Under heavy reconstruction
Basically I want to re-write everything. The old version is a mess.

Goal for this reconstruction
- Supports per channel gameplay
- Better interaction
- Better combos detection
- Stop dumping everything into bot command functions
- Spread functions into smaller pieces
- Make my life easier
